# Basic Tic-Tac-Toe game!

Wanted to make a simple game, so what better than Tic-Tac-Toe!

It is completely functional, but in the future I would love to add an option to play against an AI opponent when you don't have 2 human players!

Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8dXnuVwmA8) to get the basic layout, but made many improvements for functionality. (I will list my updates at the bottom of the page)

Updates: The game would not reset to the "X" player when a round ended, that has been fixed. Fixed game so resetting the board works properly, even when there is no winner for the round. Added a reset scoreboard function, which also resets the game board. Winner modal added and background color change to winning players color added. All styling was customized.
